      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Effective Date: <i>May 12, 2025</i> <br /><br />
        The “Mir Browser” app (“the App”) is committed to respecting and
        protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how the App
        handles information and outlines your rights in relation to its use.
        <br /><br />
        By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the
        practices described below. If you do not accept this Privacy Policy,
        please refrain from using the App.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>1. Information Collection and Use</i></b>
        <br /><br />
        The App is designed to operate without collecting or processing any
        personal or non-personal data. It does not:
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access or store your identity, device identifiers, or location</li>
        <br />
        <li>Track your activity or behavior</li>
        <br />
        <li>Transmit user information to external servers by itself</li>
        <br />
        <li>Collect usage statistics, analytics, or crash logs</li>
        <br /><br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, because the App uses Android WebView for browsing, your
        device’s system may locally store:
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cookies and web storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Autofill credentials (logins, passwords) via the Android Autofill
          Framework
        </li>
        <br /><br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i
          >Note: These data are saved entirely by your device’s system. The App
          itself neither reads nor transmits this information. </i
        ><br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>2. Permissions</i></b
        ><br /><br />
        To ensure proper operation, the App may request the following device
        permissions:
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internet access – to allow browsing functionality</li>
        <br />
        <li>Network state access – to determine online availability</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          File read/write access – to support uploading and downloading when
          interacting with websites
        </li>
        <br /><br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        These permissions are used solely for the App’s technical functionality
        and are never used to extract or share your personal data.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>3. Third-Party Content</i></b> <br /><br />
        The App does not contain advertising, third-party SDKs, or external
        tracking. However, websites accessed through the App may include content
        governed by their own privacy policies. You are responsible for
        reviewing and understanding the terms of any third-party sites you
        visit.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>4. Advertising</i></b> <br /><br />
        The App itself does not serve or display advertisements. Any promotional
        content you encounter comes from the websites you choose to visit and is
        outside the scope of this App’s functionality.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>5. User Accounts</i></b> <br /><br />
        No user registration, login, or personal identification is required or
        supported by the App. No account credentials are processed or stored by
        the App itself.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>6. Children’s Privacy</i></b> <br /><br />
        The App does not include content specifically intended for children, nor
        does it collect information from users of any age. However, since it
        allows access to third-party websites, parental supervision is
        recommended for younger users. <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>7. Data Transmission by the User</i></b> <br /><br />
        The App functions as a general-purpose web browser. As such, users may
        voluntarily submit personal or sensitive information to third-party
        websites during normal use. Any such transmission occurs solely as a
        result of user interaction and is not initiated, controlled, or
        facilitated by the App itself. The App does not assume responsibility
        for the content, data handling, or practices of external websites
        visited by the user. All responsibility for providing data to third
        parties lies with the user. <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>8. International Considerations</i></b> <br /><br />
        This Privacy Policy serves as a general, global statement of how the App
        treats data. It is provided for informational purposes only and does not
        constitute legal advice. You are responsible for ensuring that your use
        of the App complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your
        jurisdiction. <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>9. Limitation of Liability</i></b> <br /><br />
        The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” with no warranties of
        any kind, express or implied. You agree that the Developer shall not be
        held liable for any form of damage, harm, loss, or consequence arising
        out of or related to the use of the App or access to third-party content
        — including, but not limited to:
        <br /><br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data loss or corruption</li>
        <br />
        <li>Financial or commercial damages</li>
        <br />
        <li>Exposure to harmful or offensive content</li>
        <br />
        <li>Unauthorized or illegal use</li>
        <br />
        <li>Device malfunction or reduced performance</li>
        <br />
        <li>Violation of laws or third-party policies</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Any other direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
        </li>
        <br /><br />
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using the App, you waive any and all claims against the Developer in
        connection with your experience. Use of the App is entirely at your own
        risk. <br /><br /><br />
        <b><i>10. Updates</i></b> <br /><br />
        This Privacy Policy may be revised at any time. The most current version
        will always be available within the App or on the associated website.
        Continued use of the App following any changes constitutes acceptance of
        the updated Policy. <br /><br /><br />
